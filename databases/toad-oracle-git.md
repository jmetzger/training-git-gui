# Toad for Oracle and GIT

## What ? 

Toad for Oracle provides a way to manage your database objects
locally. 

This is done through Utilities->Team Coding->Select VCS Project  
(different VCS's are support: git, svn a.s.o) 

Locally it uses git for windows (which you also need to install, as it 
uses the executable).

```
From the Toad main menu select Utilities – Team Coding – Select VCS Project. 
The Git login window will open. Enter the information for repository, Git User and Git email. Click Ok
```
